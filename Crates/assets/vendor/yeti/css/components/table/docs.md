## When to use it

Rows and columns of data: prices, results, comparisons. If the content is a list of things with a picture each, that is a `grid` of cards, not a table.

## How it works

The class goes on the `table`. Cells get padding from `data-size` and a line beneath each row; the header row gets a stronger rule. `data-striped` tints every other row, `data-hover` the row under the pointer, `data-border` draws every cell. Mark a column of numbers with `data-numeric` on its cells and header: they align to the end with tabular figures, so the digits line up. The marker works on any element, a price or a legend's values, where it gives the figures alone. A comparison, a feature column and a column per plan, reads across best when the columns are equal: `data-fixed` gives every column the same share of the width, whatever it holds. To make the first column wider, give its header cell a width, `<th style="inline-size: 40%">`, and the others share the rest. `data-align="center"` (or `start`, `end`) on a `th` or `td` aligns that cell, and on a `tr` every cell in the row; a cell's own value, or its `data-numeric`, outranks its row's. A tick in a centered cell is an inline `svg`, and the reset makes an `svg` a block, so wrap it in an `icon` or give it `display: inline-block` for the alignment to reach it.

```html
<table class="table" data-fixed aria-label="Plans compared">
	<thead><tr><th scope="col" style="inline-size: 40%">Feature</th><th scope="col" data-align="center">Free</th><th scope="col" data-align="center">Walker</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody><tr data-align="center"><th scope="row" data-align="start">Offline maps</th><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody>
</table>
```

`data-sticky` on the `thead` pins the header row at `--yeti-sticky-offset` while the rows scroll under it; its cells take the surface color so the rows do not show through, and the rule beneath them moves with them. Set the offset to `0` on the `thead` to pin it flush with the top. A table that is wider than its container goes inside a `scroller`, which scrolls it sideways while the table itself stays a table. `data-nowrap` on the table keeps every cell's line; on a single `th` or `td` it keeps just that cell's; either way, put the table in a scroller so the kept line has somewhere to go.

```html
<div class="scroller" role="region" aria-label="Quarterly results" tabindex="0">
	<table class="table" data-size="sm" data-border>
		<caption>Quarterly results</caption>
		<thead><tr><th scope="col">Region</th><th scope="col" data-numeric>Q1</th><th scope="col" data-numeric>Q2</th></tr></thead>
		<tbody><tr><th scope="row">North</th><td data-numeric>120</td><td data-numeric>132</td></tr></tbody>
	</table>
</div>
```

## Accessibility

A table needs a name: a `caption`, or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` on the element. Header cells carry `scope`. Yeti never turns a table into stacked cards at narrow widths, because that breaks the relationships a screen reader depends on; use a `scroller` and keep the table a table.
