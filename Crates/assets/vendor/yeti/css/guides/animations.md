# Animations

<p class="lede">Everything that moves in Yeti reads a duration token, and that is what makes reduced motion work.</p>

## Durations collapse, end states stay

Yeti never removes an effect for a reader who has asked for less motion. It shortens it. Every animation and transition in the framework reads `--yeti-duration-fast` or `--yeti-duration-base`, and under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` both collapse to `0.01ms`. A dialog still opens, a card still lifts, a `lift` still changes color. They simply arrive rather than travel.

That is a deliberate choice over `animation: none`. An effect switched off mid-way can strand an element somewhere its layout did not put it, and the reader is left looking at a half-open panel or nothing at all. A collapsed duration always ends where the CSS says it ends.

It is also why the reset's universal rule is not the mechanism. A declaration in the components layer outranks a universal one in the reset, so that rule only reaches animation the browser or a third party brought. Yeti's own motion is stilled by its tokens.

Utilities that are entirely about movement carry their own pair, so tuning one gesture never moves another: `enter` has `--yeti-enter-duration`, `lift` has its own distance and shadow, and page transitions have `--yeti-page-duration`.

## Page transitions

A browser can crossfade between two documents instead of snapping, with no script. Yeti does not turn this on. Turn it on in your own stylesheet, with one rule:

```css
@view-transition { navigation: auto; }
```

Both pages need it and they must be same-origin, so for a site built on one stylesheet it is on everywhere or nowhere.

Yeti leaves that rule to you for two reasons. Cross-document view transitions are below Baseline, and Yeti's rule is that a feature below Baseline is guarded rather than assumed. There is also nothing to guard it with: `@view-transition` is an at-rule with no element to select, so unlike every other opt-in in Yeti it cannot hang off a class. Where the feature is missing, Firefox as this is written, the navigation just snaps and nothing is broken.

What Yeti does supply is the timing:

| Token | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--yeti-page-duration` | `200ms` | How long the crossfade takes |
| `--yeti-page-ease` | `ease` | The curve it runs on |

The animation itself stays the browser's. Its crossfade already blends the two snapshots correctly, which a hand-written pair of opacity keyframes does not: those dip through the page background halfway unless they also carry `mix-blend-mode`. Yeti changes when it runs, not what it does.

Re-timing it is also the only way to honour reduced motion here. No selector reaches an at-rule, and the reset's universal rule does not match a `::view-transition` pseudo-element, so the collapsed `--yeti-page-duration` is what stills the crossfade. Write your own view-transition animations and you take that back on yourself, so read the same two tokens if you do.

A page transition is a whole-page crossfade and nothing more. Carrying one element across two pages needs `view-transition-name` on both, which Yeti has no vocabulary for yet.

## Scroll-driven

Two things in Yeti are paced by the scroll rather than the clock: an `enter` with `data-view` plays its arrival as the element comes into view, and a `progress` with `data-scroll` fills as the page is read. Both use `animation-timeline`, which is below Baseline, so both are guarded by `@supports`, and each fallback is honest: the arrival plays on load, and the reading bar is not shown. They answer reduced motion differently, on purpose. The arrival is switched off, because a scroll-paced animation ignores the collapsed duration and would move content a reader asked not to see move. The reading bar stays, because nothing in it moves on its own; it only mirrors the reader's hand.

### A marker along a path

A dot that walks a curve as the page scrolls: an SVG draws the path, and the marker's `offset-path` repeats the same `d`, so a circle riding it can be paced by `animation-timeline: scroll(root)` instead of the clock.

```css
.marker {
	offset-path: path("M0,20 Q100,0 200,20 T400,20");
	offset-distance: 100%;
}

@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {
	.marker {
		animation: walk linear both;
		animation-timeline: scroll(root);
	}
}

@keyframes walk {
	from { offset-distance: 0%; }
	to { offset-distance: 100%; }
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
	.marker {
		animation: none;
	}
}
```

The base rule puts the marker at the end of the walk, and only the animation inside `@supports` starts it at 0%. Where scroll timelines are missing, or motion is reduced, the dot rests at the end: a marker parked at the start would claim the reader had not moved, the same reason the reading bar is not shown at all without a timeline. Reduced motion does not collapse the duration here, because a scroll-driven animation never reads one; instead the rule turns the animation off outright, and the dot falls back to that resting place, reading as arrived rather than stranded at the start.

The path is repeated from the SVG, not read from it: CSS has no way to reference an element's `d`, so the same coordinates live in both places and a change to one is a change to the other. The `path()` coordinates are CSS pixels of the marker's containing block, so an SVG that scales through its `viewBox` needs the path scaled with it, or the marker drifts off the drawn line.
